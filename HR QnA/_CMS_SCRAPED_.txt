With more than 4000 employees spread across over 100 locations in India, CMS Computers is adding value to every industry through its products, services and offerings. 
Over the last 37 years, CMS has played an integral role in helping clients succeed through many economic cycles. CMS Computers provides expertise and experience delivering governance services, transportation & traffic solutions, energy management solutions, surveillance and workforce management, broadcasting solutions as well as software services aligning technology with client businesses.

Since inception, CMS had a clear vision of leveraging the tremendous power of information technology for improving the quality of life of people ― rather than just automating client infrastructures.

Home       About Us      Our Founder



Our Founder

RAMESH D. GROVER
Founder & Chairman, CMS Group of Companies
(October 24, 1945 - March 5, 2011)

Humble Beginnings
The Late Shri Ramesh D. Grover is one of the pioneers of the technology revolution in India. His vision not only helped set up the CMS Empire, but also helped in creating new opportunities in the IT business, some of which were later adopted by several startups as well as large corporate houses.


Shri Ramesh Grover was born in a modest home in Lahore. One of ten siblings, his father was employed with the Indian Railways. The family decided to move from Lahore to India in 1947 like many other families who were faced with socio-political unrest triggered by the Partition.


Ramesh did his schooling in Delhi, followed by his graduation at the prestigious BITS Pilani. He was a Mechanical Engineer with a deep interest in Electronics. Labeled as somewhat of an ‘Electronic Genius’ his passion led him to assemble radios and transistors, which he eventually sold to his friends for some pocket money.


After graduating from BITS, Ramesh started working with Larsen & Toubro. However, his love for electronics left him restless. He joined IBM in Mumbai by cracking the qualifying test with a perfect score. He had a reputation of being the most sought-after service engineer in IBM. Within three years of service, he was elevated to the position of Customer Service Manager and won several awards at IBM.


The future of the IT industry and Ramesh Grover was looking promising until Indira Gandhi Government passed Foreign Exchange Regulation Act in 1973, a legislation that came as a major blow to foreign trade and multi-national companies in the country. As the act forced IBM to exit the Indian market in 1978, Ramesh realised the need of the hour for an indigenous service provider — a company that could absorb the talents that was rendered jobless with the exit of IBM.


“We all took a leap and started off this company,” say Srinivasan Ramadorai and Varun Kumar Prasad, the co-founders of the company.

 

Mr Grover always identified talented people who could take it to the next level and encourage them.

 
 

 
The Rising Star
CMS grew by leaps and bounds as it acquired accounts from companies like Philips, ACC, Premier Automobiles and Union Carbide for their maintenance business. In 1984, CMS acquired Europe-based SYSTIME computers and became India’s first end-to-end IT solutions company. Given this new start, the restless Shri Grover expanded the business to areas like smart cards, traffic signals, printing systems, cash management and ERP.

Aarti Grover, current Managing Director, CMS computers, and daughter of the Shri Ramesh Grover, says “The key to what makes CMS different is an insight into customer need. For core infrastructure services, India had the need but didn’t have ‘Indian prices’. So my father created three R&D centers across the country in Pune, Bombay and Trivandrum, where we created products and innovated.”


In subsequent years, CMS became a leading IT giant in India, ranked as one of the top companies by various customer satisfaction surveys. Today, CMS serves over thousands of customers and has more than 4,000 employees with 100 offices in India and the company’s relationship with pioneering firms of various industries spans decades.


The group is currently in the process of leveraging its scale and reach, with an aim to expand its offerings of high value and innovative end-to-end solutions in the IT and outsourced business segments. Ramesh’s dream has translated into the CMS vision. His mantra for the company was, “We are a customer-oriented company. We are dedicated to innovation and quality, in providing cost-effective solutions to our customers in the area of information technology.”             

His human face

Mr Grover was a humble man. He spent a large sum of money on charity, but never spoke about these acts. In one of his biggest philanthropic contributions, he donated a large land parcel for the cause of building a cancer hospital. He partnered with India’s leading oncologists, and gave them a platform to fulfill their dreams of building the first ever state-of the-art, dedicated cancer care facility in Mumbai.


He always motivated his employees to deliver better, which manifested in him sometimes being a strict taskmaster for the benefit of the firm. “I’ve been with CMS for more than two decades. If you look at various divisions of the group, most of the leaders have been with the group for long and have grown with the firm. Mr Grover always identified talent—people who could take it to the next level—and encourage them. He never had ego. We did have argument at times, but he would come back to us in the evening, put his arm around us and, sometimes, even take us out for a drink,” reminisces Maurice D’Souza, Chief Operating Officer, CMS Computers Limited.


Despite maintaining 18-hour- work schedule for his entire life, Mr Grover never let his work get in the way of spending time with his family.


Shri Ramesh D. Grover was a visionary and an epitome of diligence and perseverance throughout his life. He will remain a source of inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs and leaders in the country.

Incubation at CMS


Giving Wings to Ideas 
The CMS Business Incubation initiative aims to provide a conducive and scalable environment in which emerging companies and entrepreneurs can develop and achieve sustainable growth.
Since Inception, CMS has encouraged a culture of innovation internally which helped create several businesses ahead of the curve. The emphasis has always been to support solutions which simplify lives taking advantage of Information technology.
It is our strong belief that information technology can play a transformational role in improving the quality of life of citizens across the world. Quality of life can be improved by raising the economic competitiveness, creating avenues for sustainable incomes down to the villages and having solutions addressing issues affecting citizens daily. Effective harnessing of knowledge, technology and entrepreneurship can accelerate this process of evolution.
CMS Business Incubation Initiative
Leveraging Technology innovations creates competitive advantage across several areas including operations, client experience and revenue models for corporations. The powerful confluence of Social Technologies, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud with information at the centre are opportunistically aligned to facilitate this vision.
The CMS Business Incubation initiative is dedicated to providing a conducive and scalable environment in which emerging companies and entrepreneurs can develop and achieve sustainable growth. The emphasis is on promoting entrepreneurs who have passion to work with technologies which help simplify lives and leverage Social, Mobile, Content and Analytics elements. CMS’s Incubation model creates cutting edge technology companies solving real world problems becoming in the process profitable businesses creating employment and economic growth.
Why Incubate?

The combination of Internet of Things, technologies like Mobility & Analytics are narrowing the gap between the real world and IT world. Successful companies are leveraging this change. CMS has been at the forefront of leveraging Internet of Things to solve real world issues. Be it traffic controllers, energy meters, workforce management, Collaboration solutions or delivering government services to citizens, CMS has delivered answers to real world issues challenging mankind.
Our Real world experience and mentoring creates a synergistic environment where entrepreneurs can learn, create working partnerships that opens doors to fresh markets. Incubation fast-tracks the growth of early stage businesses, improving the survival rate of start-up companies and entrepreneur initiatives by helping them be viable.
Incubation Process
We follow a very simple process in our Incubation program. Are you playing in cutting edge technology domains? Do you have solutions which can transform the way people work, live and play? Does your solution have the potential to scale up? Do you see untapped market opportunity that are potentially large? If you answered yes to any of these questions, we can have a discussion and fast track the process.
The process begins with a careful evaluation of the companies or entrepreneurs and their industries. The Incubation initiative looks for clients with potentially scalable business models in dynamic, high-growth industries. We are specifically attracted to companies in the SMAC area as well as growing markets like Security, Content Management, Systems management, Internet of Things etc. A careful screening prepares companies for the challenges of sustenance, scale and success. We invest in management and not just in an idea, thereby clearly differentiating from the classical incubation models in the market. While we have a fairly systemized documented process, the incubation initiative allows for flexibility.
The formal incubation process takes place through a series of strategic working sessions which helps in fleshing out the market, opportunities, challenges, financing requirement, technology selection and manpower planning.  This helps build the nucleus of a business plan including revenue, markets, resource requirements, headcount growth and key growth engines and inhibitors.
Our experience across industry domains as well as technical expertise helps participants create a business model, develop prototypes, carry out demos, trials, develop a financial plan and finally build a clear roadmap into the market. At the heart of our engagement is the mentoring process done by technology professionals, sales/marketing practitioners as well as finance professionals. The mentor can help identify the opportunities and challenges to the business, effectively providing guidance to achieving goals. The engagement is continuous and very often on demand, complementing the infrastructure facility support that is available on tap.
This provides entrepreneurs and early stage companies with the opportunity to focus on their business including product development, business development, sales and client relationship management leaving the operational challenges to CMS. The CMS promise to early stage cutting edge technology companies is our unflinching support in setting up a sustainable and successful business, which could still use some financial support and coaching. We will help you strive and thrive.  Come talk to us.

The daunting task of delivering public utilities in remotest locations is full of operational challenges in India. Government agencies struggle with poor infrastructure and distribution network, while rural citizens have to travel long distances to avail government services.
The centre and various state governments have indeed taken several path-breaking initiatives over the last decades to fill the gaps in the distribution network through information technology. Government agencies have partnered with leading technology firms like CMS to build ambitious nationwide IT infrastructure and distribution channels, where public utilities can be become more accessible and transparent to citizens.
Common Service Centers  

CMS has collaborated with central and state-run agencies for various projects and played a significant role in connecting lakhs of villages with government departments. The biggest example of our success is Common Services Centres (CSCs). Launched in 2006, this flagship scheme was implemented under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) with an idea to set up one-stop shop facility for providing multiple services in far-flung locations.
CMS has been a major catalyst in expanding the base of CSCs across the country. It has built a robust distribution chain, developed brilliant IT architecture and created plethora of job and business opportunities in some of the remotest locations of the country.
Thousands of youths have joined the bandwagon to become village-level entrepreneurs. Moreover, many hardware and software professionals are hired to monitor the project on district levels. Going forward, CMS intends to address the needs of rural population in key areas of agriculture, education, vocational training, health and hygiene.
Through the CSC scheme, the government committed itself to addressing the divide and brought its rural citizens closer to the economic opportunities available to their urban counterparts.

Land Records Systems

Land and property records management is one of the most formidable tasks for a state government as it needs constant updates, rigorous monitoring and full of legal tangles. 
Besides, a large portion of state land is agricultural. Land records are maintained in different prescribed forms registers at the village/ tehsil/district levels and consist of various information like cropped area, type of irrigation, crop type, land ownership, record of land transfer, land revenue etc. 
The data available for land records are vast and it is not possible to update without the help of specialized tools. 
Speedy updates of records through the use of IT&C tools increases the efficiency and reduces hardship for the public to get certified copies of their own land records with updated details in a short and transparent manner. 
CMS is actively working with various state governments for building robust IT architectures for record keeping systems. States like Punjab and Maharashtra have been benefitted by our bespoke solutions. 
Our land records systems have brought a great deal of transparency on the subject of ownership and category of properties. This change is helping state governments draft their policies and plan investments in a more prudent way. 
Benefits Of CMS Land Record Systems

Landowners can access land records and procure land and revenue certificates from any place, any time.

Tele-Education/e-Learning/Virtual Classroom

CMS plays a pivotal role in providing a technological edge to the education sector through distance learning and communication solutions. CMS has commissioned a number of solutions across premier institutes on Media Labs, e-Learning and High Performance Computing.
CMS Solutions for Distance Education include

Virtual Classroom/e-classroom
Wi-Fi Campus
Virtual Library
Guest Lectures Through Internet or WAN
Audio/Video Conferencing
Media Lab
HPC (High Performance Computing)

The main modes of communication are audio, video and computer enabled. Audio technologies involve the transmission of audio (voice) between learners and instructors, either synchronously or asynchronously. Examples of asynchronous transmission include audio-conferencing and short wave radio; while examples of the asynchronous transmission include audiotapes or audiocassettes.
Video for distance learning, like audio, can be used in either synchronous or asynchronous modes. Synchronous Videoconferencing, or interactive television, is when there is an opportunity for live visual and verbal interaction between instructors and learners. Asynchronous instructional video tools include slow-scan video, interactive videodiscs and videotapes.
Computer-assisted learning or instructions can be defined as learning mediated by a computer, which requires no direct interaction between the user and a human instructor in order to run. This practice is becoming increasingly common. Examples include: the Internet, email, synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated communication applications and interactive multimedia applications on CD-ROM.
CMS Computers provides whole integration in Tele-education. Its comprises of Video and Audio two way communication between students and the Instructor. Every Student can raise queries regarding any topic at any time with their computers and then a pop-up shows up on the Instructor’s Screen. Audio technologies involve the transmission of the spoken word (voice) between learners and instructors, either synchronously or asynchronously. 


Tele-Medicine & Bio-informatics

With over 30 years of experience in broadcast and IT, CMS has joined hands with the medical fraternity to offer state-of-the-art Tele-medicine facilities to our customers. We not only provide solutions to the medical fraternity and research institutions for IT and content management integration into their existing Hospital Information System (HIS) systems but also set up new systems as greenfield projects. 
Telemedicine is the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology. Nationally, the technology is gaining momentum across premier medical institutions as well as rural healthcare projects (E-Gov). 
CMS’s Tele-medicine solution is an end-to-end solution for distance healthcare. CMS Tele-medicine solutions are available for administrative meetings, committee or planning meetings,research collaboration conferences, audio/video conferences between doctors or professional education and training interviews. Clinicians can meet regularly for a variety of education activities, including broadcasting rounds, journal clubs and case presentations to colleagues. CMS also covers all telemedicine and bio-informatics related solutions like

Tele-conferencing (Audio/Video)
Virtual Operation Theatre (OT)
Real time or synchronous Telemedicine (Interactive Video-conferencing)
Store and forward telemedicine or Asynchronous (tele-pathology, tele-radiology, tele-dermatolgy, etc.)
Disaster management (Therapy in natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, etc.)
Tele-therapy 
Tele-Education (Medical courses/classes can be scheduled and conducted for students/doctors/specialists remotely)
Primary care and specialist referral services
Remote patient monitoring
Consumer medical and health information 

These education sessions may involve two centers (point-to-point) or more than two centers, connected at one node (multi-point). The real advantage of using videoconferencing for education is that multi-disciplinary teams from different institutions can participate in a single event. 
This ability to connect with teams from different regions enriches the learning experience for everyone involved. Many hospitals or group of hospitals can connect via telemedicine or video-conferencing to take up suggestions or discuss medical problems of patients seeking advice over a simple telephone to transmission of electronic medical records of clinical information. Using real-time interactive video-conferencing doctors can carry out diagnostic tests such as E.C.G.

count down timers (CDT)





The Count Down Timer (CDT) displays the time remaining on traffic signals. Fixed time traffic signal systems have a major drawback of comparatively larger waiting periods due to irregular traffic characteristics. 
Count Down Timers play a very important role in saving fuel lost while waiting at junctions. Vehicle users are not aware of signal timings at intersections & typically don’t switch off their engines. This causes a fair amount of loss of fuel, while also adding to rising pollution levels. 
CDTs help reduces driver anxiety by enabling lower noise pollution while also serving as a deterrent for signal jumping.

vehicle detectors



Loop Based Vehicle Detectors
Video Based Vehicle Detectors



There are a number of ways to detect vehicles and inductive loop technology is the most reliable, bar none. CMS offers Loop based vehicle detector systems that allow for better traffic control.
The loop vehicle detector system consists of three components: a loop (preformed or saw-cut), loop extension cable and a detector.
OUTPUTS:
STANDARD  - RELAY
5 Normally closed contact, relay energized on power up and released on detection of vehicle (fail-safe output, on power failure, open circuit or short circuit of loop).
LED Indications
1. Green LED lights at power on & switched off to indicate fault on any channel.
2.  Four Red LED’s for detect / no detect indication.
OPERATING TEMPERATURE RANGE:  0°C  - 70°C
SUPPLY: 12 ± 1 V DC
INDUCTANCE RANGE: 20 – 2000 mH (AUTOMATICALLY TUNED)
FAIL SAFE OPERATION:
A permanent detection output will be given in the event of open circuit loop short circuit loop or power failure (relay output). The detector resumes normal operation as soon as it sees an "in range "inductance, except in the case of a short circuit close to its terminals, then the fault will be permanently latched and that channel will be skipped in the detector scan. The detector will also self heal following an excessively large inductance change by re-tuning itself to the new inductance.
MODES: 
Each channel can be individually set to either presence or passage in presence mode, a detection output is given whilst a vehicle is present. In passage mode, a pulse output (100ms to 135ms) is given on vehicle entry. Further outputs are inhibited for 2 seconds unless the loop is fully cleared.
FREQUENCY:
Crosstalk between four channels of one unit cannot occur. Should crosstalk occur between channels on two different units a frequency selection jumper is provided to set high or low frequency.
CHANNEL OFF: 
Each channel can be disabled by putting all switches on that channel as skipped in a scan sequence.
RESET:
A reset push button is provided. Whenever switch settings are changed or retuning is required press the reset button. All switches are read by the controller inON Power,ONReset or Manual Reset modes.

Creating a New Ecosystem for Public Sector
For more than three decades, CMS Computers has been playing a pivotal role in enabling and promoting smart governance in India, and integrating citizen services with information technology. The company has been working closely with various government entities to ensure effective implementation of public policies and make organizations more transparent and efficient. CMS Computers partners with government establishments, defense establishments and public sector units to offer technology solutions in areas that are critical for the nation and its citizens.  
Client’s Requirements: 

Robust delivery systems for efficient implementation of government schemes and policies.
To address the needs of a large segment of citizens and consumers cutting across geographical and demographic lines.
To mitigate costs on input and operations.
Sustainable solutions which can support project in the long run.
Optimal utility of public resources.
An assessment model to analyse the success of government initiatives.
To safeguard information and data critical for the country’s security.
A transparent framework for delivery systems.
To expedite implementation cycles and avoid time overruns. 

Our Strengths
Experience: There are only a few IT solution providers in the country that offer nearly 40 years of experience in the government domain. CMS’s Government Solutions division brings unmatched expertise and know-how to the table when it comes to understanding administrative challenges and enabling services which are meant to cover vast geographical and demographic boundaries.
Innovation: The Research & Development unit at CMS Computers has developed a wide range of products and systems tailor-made for government establishments. The Aadhar Card project, Intelligent Traffic Solutions in cities and installation of security systems at security-sensitive establishments such as Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) are some of the large-scale public projects which entirely run on the systems and software built by CMS Computers.
Economy: Number of stakeholders and users in a public project is larger than one governed by a private enterprise. Therefore, budget optimization and mitigating operational costs is instrumental in the success of a government project, as the schemes typically feature a long gestation period. CMS helps stakeholders rationalize expenditure by developing systems which are robust, long-lasting and require minimum maintenance. 
Management: If technology is the brain of smart governance, then management is the backbone of it. Our Government Solutions Division provides complete end-to-end solutions after a detailed study of what kind of framework will be required in the operations of a project.

Financial Inclusion

When new regulations of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) came into effect recently, we had to upgrade our ABT Monitoring system as per the new guidelines. The process to change the dashboards and readings was very intricate and we were seeking an expert who could modify our systems in a short span of time.  We joined hands with CMS Computers for the project and its engineers did an outstanding job by successfully upgrading the system within the scheduled time. The modification process didn’t pose any disturbance to our online monitoring interface. Their technical experts are not only well-equipped with experience and knowledge of ABT systems but they are also highly responsive and active. A utility can totally bank upon CMS when it comes to ABT solutions.

Mr. Mohammad Gayasuddin - Chief. Manager.Construction I/C Â– KJPL P/L Projects 







When new regulations of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) came into effect recently, we had to upgrade our ABT Monitoring system as per the new guidelines. The process to change the dashboards and readings was very intricate and we were seeking an expert who could modify our systems in a short span of time.  We joined hands with CMS Computers for the project and its engineers did an outstanding job by successfully upgrading the system within the scheduled time. The modification process didn’t pose any disturbance to our online monitoring interface. Their technical experts are not only well-equipped with experience and knowledge of ABT systems but they are also highly responsive and active. A utility can totally bank upon CMS when it comes to ABT solutions.

Neyveli lignite Corporation, Neyveli, Chennai - General Manager







The whole experience of working with CMS computers is very pleasant. They have designed a superb and tailor-made Energy Management System for us. They have quality products and solutions backed by a professional, cooperating and hard working team. The best part is they are always willing to walk the extra mile to suit and satisfy your requirement. With such a diversified product portfolio and an attitude to excel in customer satisfaction, we’re confident that CMS computers will meet all of your plant’s needs as they have done for us.

Incubation at CMS


Giving Wings to Ideas 
The CMS Business Incubation initiative aims to provide a conducive and scalable environment in which emerging companies and entrepreneurs can develop and achieve sustainable growth.
Since Inception, CMS has encouraged a culture of innovation internally which helped create several businesses ahead of the curve. The emphasis has always been to support solutions which simplify lives taking advantage of Information technology.
It is our strong belief that information technology can play a transformational role in improving the quality of life of citizens across the world. Quality of life can be improved by raising the economic competitiveness, creating avenues for sustainable incomes down to the villages and having solutions addressing issues affecting citizens daily. Effective harnessing of knowledge, technology and entrepreneurship can accelerate this process of evolution.
CMS Business Incubation Initiative
Leveraging Technology innovations creates competitive advantage across several areas including operations, client experience and revenue models for corporations. The powerful confluence of Social Technologies, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud with information at the centre are opportunistically aligned to facilitate this vision.
The CMS Business Incubation initiative is dedicated to providing a conducive and scalable environment in which emerging companies and entrepreneurs can develop and achieve sustainable growth. The emphasis is on promoting entrepreneurs who have passion to work with technologies which help simplify lives and leverage Social, Mobile, Content and Analytics elements. CMS’s Incubation model creates cutting edge technology companies solving real world problems becoming in the process profitable businesses creating employment and economic growth.
Why Incubate?

The combination of Internet of Things, technologies like Mobility & Analytics are narrowing the gap between the real world and IT world. Successful companies are leveraging this change. CMS has been at the forefront of leveraging Internet of Things to solve real world issues. Be it traffic controllers, energy meters, workforce management, Collaboration solutions or delivering government services to citizens, CMS has delivered answers to real world issues challenging mankind.
Our Real world experience and mentoring creates a synergistic environment where entrepreneurs can learn, create working partnerships that opens doors to fresh markets. Incubation fast-tracks the growth of early stage businesses, improving the survival rate of start-up companies and entrepreneur initiatives by helping them be viable.
Incubation Process
We follow a very simple process in our Incubation program. Are you playing in cutting edge technology domains? Do you have solutions which can transform the way people work, live and play? Does your solution have the potential to scale up? Do you see untapped market opportunity that are potentially large? If you answered yes to any of these questions, we can have a discussion and fast track the process.
The process begins with a careful evaluation of the companies or entrepreneurs and their industries. The Incubation initiative looks for clients with potentially scalable business models in dynamic, high-growth industries. We are specifically attracted to companies in the SMAC area as well as growing markets like Security, Content Management, Systems management, Internet of Things etc. A careful screening prepares companies for the challenges of sustenance, scale and success. We invest in management and not just in an idea, thereby clearly differentiating from the classical incubation models in the market. While we have a fairly systemized documented process, the incubation initiative allows for flexibility.
The formal incubation process takes place through a series of strategic working sessions which helps in fleshing out the market, opportunities, challenges, financing requirement, technology selection and manpower planning.  This helps build the nucleus of a business plan including revenue, markets, resource requirements, headcount growth and key growth engines and inhibitors.
Our experience across industry domains as well as technical expertise helps participants create a business model, develop prototypes, carry out demos, trials, develop a financial plan and finally build a clear roadmap into the market. At the heart of our engagement is the mentoring process done by technology professionals, sales/marketing practitioners as well as finance professionals. The mentor can help identify the opportunities and challenges to the business, effectively providing guidance to achieving goals. The engagement is continuous and very often on demand, complementing the infrastructure facility support that is available on tap.
This provides entrepreneurs and early stage companies with the opportunity to focus on their business including product development, business development, sales and client relationship management leaving the operational challenges to CMS. The CMS promise to early stage cutting edge technology companies is our unflinching support in setting up a sustainable and successful business, which could still use some financial support and coaching. We will help you strive and thrive.  Come talk to us.

Overview


Re-Imagining A New World
CMS has always been at the vanguard of the IT movement in India with the sole objective to empower people with technological advancements.
Founded as Computer Maintenance and Services Company in 1976, CMS Computers Limited is a pioneer and leader in the Indian ICT industry. With more than 4000 employees spread across over 100 locations in India, CMS Computers is adding value to every industry through its products, services and offerings. 
Over the last 37 years, CMS has played an integral role in helping clients succeed through many economic cycles. CMS Computers provides expertise and experience delivering governance services, transportation & traffic solutions, energy management solutions, surveillance and workforce management, broadcasting solutions as well as software services aligning technology with client businesses.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Associate companies of CMS Computers, CMS Infosystems and Kaycee Industries are uniquely positioned as leaders in their operating areas. Uniquely positioned as India’s largest cash management services organisation, CMS Infosystems is also a leader across varied business lines including Managed IT Services, Print and Digital Solutions and IT training.
Since inception, CMS had a clear vision of leveraging the tremendous power of information technology for improving the quality of life of people ― rather than just automating client infrastructures. We imagined a world where industrial companies become service companies, where energy companies leverage information to manage energy usage, broadcasting companies become commerce players, government leveraging technology to bring in more efficiency in governance, and urban planners using transportation and surveillance solutions to make our cities secure and livable.   

 As a pioneer in traffic, e-governance, broadcasting, energy and security, we have simplified lives of citizens, corporations and the government by digitally empowering machines, increasing our insight and taking more control of the tangible world. Our people form the bedrock of CMS with strong emphasis on driving a high performance culture. Our talent management model includes strong elements of performance management, leadership development and ongoing skills development.
 CMS’s long track record is also attributed to its enviable client base, unrivalled domain expertise, and strategic partnerships. With a strong culture of excellence, we will continue to simplify lives, leveraging cutting edge innovations in technology.

Big Future: CMS's Roadmap

Increasing integration of the world economy creates discontinuities and powerful forces which throw up various challenges for countries and corporations. The past several years have been characterized by crises that never seem to end. The dotcom bubble of 2000 was followed very quickly by the sub prime crisis in 2007. There was no let up thereafter with the European currency crisis and a slow down across BRIC countries including India. Similar changes happened across the digital world too. The physical world and the IT world are converging as objects, devices, and machines leverage information and participate in the digital world. This is a validation of the CMS story.

						 
Our view of the future is positive as the Economy rebounds and investments in infrastructure picks up. Across our businesses, we work with Big Data. Enterprise data, across sectors like Transportation, Energy, Media, Government is vastly underutilized. Enterprise and the Government is littered with data silos, limiting the value that organizations can get. Our Big Data play shifts focus from reporting, dashboards and mining to trending and predictive patterns enabling accurate decision making across the entire organization. Correlations from current data and historical as well as from disparate sources help in better decision making. We are building Big Data Solutions into every one of our industry solutions as well as the assets we build.
We see huge synergy between mobility and the Internet of Things. Over decades, we have worked with devices in the natural world and today with intelligence and mobility they are able to solve real world issues. Enterprises and Government can deliver great value without complexity at the front end. Complex intelligent devices at the backend can share information, interact and deliver information with advances in mobility.  CMS's mobile applications add value across industries utilizing our expertise across areas like Traffic, Surveillance, Broadcasting, Energy and Government.

 

The physical world and the IT world are converging as objects, devices, and machines leverage information and participate in the digital world. This is a validation of the CMS story.

 
 

Innovation tops our agenda today as it has over the last several decades. Our focus is not to build new products or invent new technologies, but looking at product, process innovations to further client experience. We continue to invest in Research & Development out of our Trivandrum centre and at the Product Development centre at Mumbai the focus is around Meters, Traffic Controllers, Analytics dashboards, Workforce management products, Biometrics, Traffic solutions like ANPR as well as Mobile technologies. Our Centre of Excellence in Electronic Governance, out of Bangalore continues to support government clients and partners in delivering services right down to the village.
We are at the centre, delivering Citizen services through innovative models as the government and citizens recognise the need to enhance their productive capacity and generate new sources of growth. CMS is aligned with the government's mission and continues to play a major role in cultivating the use of information technology.

Facilitating Governance, Empowering Citizens
Pioneers of e-Governance services in India, CMS Computers is playing a crucial role in the implementation of government services in India.
Dynamic business environment and increasing accountability are prompting governments to become more competitive and transparent. Government organisations in India also face multiple challenges in reaching out to citizens due to the vast population and diverse demographics of the country.
To overcome these impediments, CMS is working closely with government bodies to facilitate public utilities through Information Technology and build a modern framework of governance in India. As a leading solutions provider of e-governance services in the country, we deliver hundreds of government services right at the doorstops of millions of citizens in India every day.   
Over the years, we have built a robust delivery model by expanding our network of service centres and workforce across the rural pockets and major urban centres in India. 

 

Our ICT projects have created thousands of employment opportunities and facilitate the implementation of various national

and state-level policies. 

 

Government services including utility bills, certificates, landholding records, taxation and education, reach out to more than 4 million rural citizens and 3 million urban citizens every month.Besides, We also taking key services such as transportation, telecommunications and health to small cities and remotest regions of the country. 
In the past 12 years, CMS Computers has taken several path-breaking initiatives in the area of e-governance such as development of print module for land records, use of video conferencing in high-sensitive criminal cases and digitization of various government offices such as Department of Stamp and Registration and Road Transport Department. Unique Identification Number or Aadhar Card is another unique and ambitious project that CMS is currently spearheading across various parts of the country.

 
The success of CMS e-Governance solutions is evident from the fact that about 1.8 million transactions are being recorded every month from its 16,780 common service centers spread across over a lakh of villages in the country. CMS Computers is committed to bringing smiles on the faces of millions of Indians by offering a wide range of consumer and public services to them.

  
































For decades, CMS’s e-Governance Division has diligently worked to propagate it solutions across various departments, ministries, governments and civic bodies. We have developed path-breaking solutions to suit various public policies and requirements for citizen services.
In addition to citizen services, we have also helped several government offices in developing systems to improve responsiveness and transparency within the departments. Our ultimate objective is to make service delivery fast and effective and make bureaucracy and administrative activities more efficient ─ at par with the dynamism of the private sector.

Integrated Citizen Services



About ICS
Urban Solutions
Rural Solutions



Reaching over 2 crore households and 1 lakh villages everyday, CMS Computers continues to be the largest service provider of Integrated Citizen Services (ICS).  The e-governance division of CMS Computers provides a one-stop shop facility where various government and customer services are provided to people, doing away with the need of citizens making rounds of various departments for their requirements.
CMS’s role in fostering the growth of integrated citizen services is unparallel. CMS has not only implemented India’s first ICS scheme, but also established the biggest network of village level entrepreneurs in the remotest locations of the country. CMS’s e-Governance team offers more than 150 utilities and has successfully implemented 12 ICS projects till now.
We have partnered with several governments, public departments and civic bodies for the implementation of key public policies and schemes. Our strong presence  in both urban as well as rural regions makes us the first choice for implementing an ICS project. We are looking to introduce more services such as financial inclusion, e-commerce and many more in near future.

The centre and various state governments have indeed taken several path-breaking initiatives over the last decades to fill the gaps in the distribution network through information technology. Government agencies have partnered with leading technology firms like CMS to build ambitious nationwide IT infrastructure and distribution channels, where public utilities can be become more accessible and transparent to citizens.
Common Service Centers  

CMS has collaborated with central and state-run agencies for various projects and played a significant role in connecting lakhs of villages with government departments. The biggest example of our success is Common Services Centres (CSCs). Launched in 2006, this flagship scheme was implemented under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) with an idea to set up one-stop shop facility for providing multiple services in far-flung locations.
CMS has been a major catalyst in expanding the base of CSCs across the country. It has built a robust distribution chain, developed brilliant IT architecture and created plethora of job and business opportunities in some of the remotest locations of the country.
Thousands of youths have joined the bandwagon to become village-level entrepreneurs. Moreover, many hardware and software professionals are hired to monitor the project on district levels. Going forward, CMS intends to address the needs of rural population in key areas of agriculture, education, vocational training, health and hygiene.
Through the CSC scheme, the government committed itself to addressing the divide and brought its rural citizens closer to the economic opportunities available to their urban counterparts.

Pulse Based Energy Accounting System



The MD-811L4 is an integrated, modular, microprocessor-based Energy and Power meter with additional Demand Calculation capabilities with respect to time, based on actual or predicted demand. This is incorporated using advanced technologies capable of measuring multiple electrical parameters in three-phase systems. It is specially designed to simultaneously measure, display, communicate and control certain electrical parameters. The readings are displayed on a 4-line 16-character LCD display. The display can be configured for auto scroll or fixed display mode(s). The display scroll time can also be set. 
For Maximum demand control, instantaneous Apparent Power must be computed over a period of time (based on the set value of integration period) and the demand will be calculated based on actual or predicted algorithm to switch ON the corresponding Digital output (up to 8 stages) based on the percentage value of the Demand set. 
The Digital control output can be reset at the start of every Demand integration cycle and calculated again for the demand value. Each Maximum Demand output control (value in %) & Contract Demand value can be set using the Keypad/ through MODBUS communication via RS-485. The 8 stages of Digital output status (ON/OFF) will be displayed on the MD Controller. Once the unit restarts, all the Digital Output’s will be initialized and checked for the Demand value again to switch ON the corresponding Digital output based on the percentage value reached.

CMS plays a pivotal role in providing a technological edge to the education sector through distance learning and communication solutions. CMS has commissioned a number of solutions across premier institutes on Media Labs, e-Learning and High Performance Computing.
CMS Solutions for Distance Education include

Virtual Classroom/e-classroom
Wi-Fi Campus
Virtual Library
Guest Lectures Through Internet or WAN
Audio/Video Conferencing
Media Lab
HPC (High Performance Computing)

The main modes of communication are audio, video and computer enabled. Audio technologies involve the transmission of audio (voice) between learners and instructors, either synchronously or asynchronously. Examples of asynchronous transmission include audio-conferencing and short wave radio; while examples of the asynchronous transmission include audiotapes or audiocassettes.
Video for distance learning, like audio, can be used in either synchronous or asynchronous modes. Synchronous Videoconferencing, or interactive television, is when there is an opportunity for live visual and verbal interaction between instructors and learners. Asynchronous instructional video tools include slow-scan video, interactive videodiscs and videotapes.
Computer-assisted learning or instructions can be defined as learning mediated by a computer, which requires no direct interaction between the user and a human instructor in order to run. This practice is becoming increasingly common. Examples include: the Internet, email, synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated communication applications and interactive multimedia applications on CD-ROM.
CMS Computers provides whole integration in Tele-education. Its comprises of Video and Audio two way communication between students and the Instructor. Every Student can raise queries regarding any topic at any time with their computers and then a pop-up shows up on the Instructor’s Screen. Audio technologies involve the transmission of the spoken word (voice) between learners and instructors, either synchronously or asynchronously. 


Tele-Medicine & Bio-informatics

With over 30 years of experience in broadcast and IT, CMS has joined hands with the medical fraternity to offer state-of-the-art Tele-medicine facilities to our customers. We not only provide solutions to the medical fraternity and research institutions for IT and content management integration into their existing Hospital Information System (HIS) systems but also set up new systems as greenfield projects. 
Telemedicine is the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology. Nationally, the technology is gaining momentum across premier medical institutions as well as rural healthcare projects (E-Gov). 
CMS’s Tele-medicine solution is an end-to-end solution for distance healthcare. CMS Tele-medicine solutions are available for administrative meetings, committee or planning meetings,research collaboration conferences, audio/video conferences between doctors or professional education and training interviews. Clinicians can meet regularly for a variety of education activities, including broadcasting rounds, journal clubs and case presentations to colleagues. CMS also covers all telemedicine and bio-informatics related solutions like

Tele-conferencing (Audio/Video)
Virtual Operation Theatre (OT)
Real time or synchronous Telemedicine (Interactive Video-conferencing)
Store and forward telemedicine or Asynchronous (tele-pathology, tele-radiology, tele-dermatolgy, etc.)
Disaster management (Therapy in natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, etc.)
Tele-therapy 
Tele-Education (Medical courses/classes can be scheduled and conducted for students/doctors/specialists remotely)
Primary care and specialist referral services
Remote patient monitoring
Consumer medical and health information 

These education sessions may involve two centers (point-to-point) or more than two centers, connected at one node (multi-point). The real advantage of using videoconferencing for education is that multi-disciplinary teams from different institutions can participate in a single event. 
This ability to connect with teams from different regions enriches the learning experience for everyone involved. Many hospitals or group of hospitals can connect via telemedicine or video-conferencing to take up suggestions or discuss medical problems of patients seeking advice over a simple telephone to transmission of electronic medical records of clinical information. Using real-time interactive video-conferencing doctors can carry out diagnostic tests such as E.C.G.
