to regulate and manage official business working \nhours across all locations of CMS Computers, CMS Traffic Systems and its \nsubsidiaries and affiliates.  \nSCOPE:  \nThis policy applies to all Full Time employees, Consultants, Independent Contract \nemployees, working with the Organization. This does not apply to staff deployed at \nclient sites who will be governed by the client contract and/or client working hours.  \nEFFECTIVE DATE:  \nThis policy is effective 1 August 2023 and supersedes all policies and guidelines \nissued earlier.  \nAll employees need to be present in office for 8.5 hours every day. Incase an \nemployee has availed Flexi hours, he/she needs to ensure the mandatory working \nhours for the day are logged in. Any shortfall in working hours during the week may \nlead to adjustment of the Earned leave proportionately. For employee convenience, \nwe have implemented flexi hours (8.5 hours within this period) which can be availed \nby all employees (other than project assigned staff at client locations). It is the \nresponsibility of the employee to keep reporting manager informed.
